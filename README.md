# LIRI (Github: https://github.com/Carl-Lombardi/LIRIBot)
This is LIRI. LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data. LIRI can take in the parameter of "Concert-This", "Spotify-This Song" and "Movie-This" to acquire information about concerts, spotify and the Online Movie Database. See screenshots for further information.

## Installation 
This is a CLI app which uses Javascript and requires the installation of Axios, Moment and the Spotify API.

## How to Use
Upon installing the necessary programs, the user will then navigate to the folder where the LIRIBot.js is located using CLI. After that, the app is opened with node LIRIBot.js and the program begins. Once that step occurs, the app is very straightforward. 

## Screenshots
Please note as this is a CLI app, that there will be a folder of screenshots which  will show every single step of the operation. 

## Issues and Solutions
The biggest issue was making sure the code remained clean throughout the coding process.
